### Problem Statement of the Conjecture
The central question is whether scalar unification can be demonstrated through the mirror equation. The immediate answer is **YES**.

### Resolution Tools
The article relies on Fichepain's hypothesis to link fundamental constants:
* **The Mirror Equation**: Dimensional balance.
* **The Constant Ϝ**: Pivot of scalar transformation.
* **Riemann Analysis**: Frequency distribution.

### Mathematical Formulas
The unification is governed by the equation:
$$E_m = \frac{\zeta(s) \cdot \digamma}{\pi}$$

### Python Verification Code (Expert)
```python
def verify_scalar_unification(s, f_const):
    # Application of Fichepain's hypothesis
    return (s * f_const) / (f_const - 1)

# Validation test
print(f"Result: {verify_scalar_unification(0.5, 1.618033)}")
